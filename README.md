# PokePS--for-Pokemon-GO
This app was designed to help locate Pokémon with crowd sourcing. If you find a Pokémon, simply add what you found and the app will create a pin on the map. The pin includes information such as the date, person, and name of the Pokémon. You can also see what others have found and get directions to it!
